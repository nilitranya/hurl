Simaris Design 6.0 is a software tool that facilitates electrical network planning on the basis of real products with minimum input â from the medium-voltage down to the socket outlet[^1^]. It is developed by Siemens, a global leader in electrical engineering and automation[^1^]. In this article, we will show you how to use Simaris Design 6.0 for your electrical network planning projects.
 
## What is Simaris Design 6.0?
 
Simaris Design 6.0 is a software tool that helps you to design and dimension electrical power distribution systems in buildings[^1^]. It allows you to enter the requirements of your specific electric power distribution system, such as load profiles, cable lengths, short-circuit currents, etc., and then it safely and reliably dimensions a system solution that is in compliance with all the relevant standards (VDE, IEC) and reflects the present state of the art[^1^]. It also provides you with detailed documentation and reports of your system design, such as single-line diagrams, bill of materials, load flow calculations, etc[^1^]. You can download Simaris Design 6.0 for free from the Siemens website[^1^].

1. Install Simaris Design 6.0 on your computer. You can download it from the Siemens website[^1^]. You will need a license key to activate the software. You can request a license key from Siemens by filling out a form on their website[^1^].
2. Launch Simaris Design 6.0 and create a new project. You can choose from different project templates, such as office building, hospital, hotel, etc., or create your own custom project[^2^]. You can also import existing projects from previous versions of Simaris Design or other software tools[^2^].
3. Define the parameters of your project, such as voltage levels, load types, load profiles, cable types, etc[^2^]. You can use the built-in database of products and standards or add your own data[^2^]. You can also adjust the settings for calculation methods, optimization criteria, documentation options, etc[^2^].
4. Design your electrical network by adding components and connections to the graphical user interface. You can use drag-and-drop or copy-paste functions to place components on the grid[^2^]. You can also use the automatic design function to let Simaris Design 6.0 generate a suitable network topology for you based on your parameters[^2^].
5. Check and optimize your electrical network by running simulations and calculations. Simaris Design 6.0 will automatically check your network for errors and warnings and suggest corrections if needed[^2^]. You can also run various simulations and calculations, such as load flow analysis, short-circuit analysis, voltage drop analysis, harmonic analysis, etc., to evaluate the performance and reliability of your network[^2^]. You can compare different scenarios and variants and optimize your network according to different criteria, such as cost, energy efficiency, space requirement, etc[^2^].
6. Document and export your electrical network by generating reports and diagrams. Simaris Design 6.0 will automatically create detailed documentation and reports of your network design, such as single-line diagrams, bill of materials, load flow calculations, etc[^2^]. You can customize the layout and content of your documentation according to your preferences and standards[^2^]. You can also export your network data to various formats, such as PDF, DWG, DXF, XML, etc., for further processing or sharing with other software tools or stakeholders[^2^].

## Conclusion
 
Simaris Design 6.0 is a powerful software tool that helps you to design and dimension electrical power distribution systems in buildings with ease and accuracy. It allows you to enter the requirements of your specific electric power distribution system and then it safely and reliably dimensions a system solution that is in compliance with all the relevant
